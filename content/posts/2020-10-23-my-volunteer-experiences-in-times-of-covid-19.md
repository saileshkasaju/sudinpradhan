Kathmandu went from lively and vibrant city to a complete standstill after government enforced lockdown at end of March 2020 in the face of global pandemic. I completed my tenure at Oxfam in Nepal at the same time and was searching for a job. While applying for jobs, I stumbled upon online volunteering opportunities at United Nations. I immediately ventured to carry out some volunteering activities during my free time. 

## Motivation

Besides my passion for engineering, bringing positive changes in peoples lives through construction and serving the general public, I have an innate passion to learn about different cultures and bring about positive change in people’s lives. Volunteering is one way to achieve that and it can be as simple as sharing information and learnings. What better place to volunteer than United Nations Volunteer (UNV). UNV has a long history of promoting volunteerism with its core values of free will, commitment, engagement, and solidarity. Being a strong organization, I contributed in promoting knowledge sharing to utilize my free time to learn while also supporting my job prospects.

## Volunteer experience

During lockdown, I volunteered for COVID-19 related research and translation work for UNDP IPC-IG remotely. From early days of college, I participated in some form volunteering activities from blood donations to distributing stationary items to Nepal Children’s Organization. I took part in Plastic Free Kathmandu Campaign and clean up events in my hometown of Patan. Being a Civil Engineer, I volunteered to do on site Rapid Damage Assessments of buildings after the earthquake in Kathmandu.

## Work experience

I worked for Oxfam Nepal for 5 years, contributing to improving lives of poor and vulnerable earthquake affected population of Kathmandu and Sindhupalchowk. I have gained first-hand experience of working with the civil societies and government while building on my leadership skills in housing settlement planning and implementation. I am currently a member of UNV Nepal in taking part in research, data collection and information sharing on online platforms.

## Skills and qualifications

After completing my bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering, I have gained critical thinking skills through technical knowledge and taking creative approach to solving problems. IT and numeracy skills such as using excel skills and communication skills such as presentation and reporting writing skills were developed during the study and while employed at Oxfam, respectively. I am adept at online research, data analysis and report writing.

## Additional information

Being a Civil Engineer, I volunteered to teach sanitation best practices, standards and proper drainage management to staffs of local NGO called ENDO Nepal during my free time. I was personally satisfied to see them work in the sanitation sector and contribute to the nation-wide “Open Defecation Free Campaign”. I have translated numerous documents in Nepali for community sensitization on Build Back Better and local partner orientation presentations on implementation strategies and policies.
