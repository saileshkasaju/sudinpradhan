description: Community-led Development (CLD) is the process of working together
  to create and achieve locally owned visions and goals. It is a planning and
  development approach that’s based on a set of core principles that (at a
  minimum) set vision and priorities by the people who live in that geographic
  community, put local voices in the lead, build on local strengths (rather than
  focus on problems), collaborate across sectors, is intentional and adaptable,
  and works to achieve systemic change rather than short-term projects.

As the world braces through one of the worst pandemic in the world, humans are by nature resilient and its nothing particularly new, given the long evolutionary history of fighting with different kinds of viruses and eventually shaping the human we know today. Economy must go on, lives must continue and as we learn to live with the virus, we must get the world moving towards development, prosperity, well-being, attain full human potential and safeguard the continuity of human life on earth.

Community-led Development (CLD) is the process of working together to create and achieve locally owned visions and goals. It is a planning and development approach that’s based on a set of core principles that (at a minimum) set vision and priorities by the people who live in that geographic community, put local voices in the lead, build on local strengths (rather than focus on problems), collaborate across sectors, is intentional and adaptable, and works to achieve systemic change rather than short-term projects.

CLD approach is not new and required now (2020) more than ever since we are moving towards localisation amid pandemic and bottom up approaches in any work undertaken. The main philosophy is one of community empowerment. It fosters broad community engagement to identify shared issues and concerns to generate local solutions. CLD operate on the principles of transparency, participation, local empowerment, demand-responsiveness, greater downward accountability, and enhanced local capacity and focusses on communities as a whole The whole idea of CLD is based on sustainability and possibility of flexible funding.
Community-led development challenges old assumptions about leadership as a few individual heroes or heroines. It intentionally works to see the leader in everyone.
Three major reasons why community led development approach is done

1. allows people to participate and feel ownership, 
2. meets urgent, relevant, and pressing needs specific to each community, and 
3. builds trusting relationships.

Basic steps of CLD (See figure)

1. Decide what you want to change(strategy)
2. Build trust and alliances with the people that can help to make the change (partnership)	
3. Define the boundaries of your area 
4. Prepare a local strategy for change based on the involvement and needs of local people
5. Agree on a partnership structure and clarify who does what 
6. Adjust boundaries
7. Prepare an action plan and funding application
8. Establish a system for periodically reviewing, evaluating, and refreshing the strategy 

Why CLD fails in Nepal and how can we improve?

* Weak political commitment 
* Community engagement without entrepreneurship 
* Unequal involvement of male and female in decision making
* Weak monitoring mechanism led by the national, sub-national government
* Lack of Multi-ministerial / Multi-sectorial coordination, collaboration, and implementation approach (both horizontal and vertical)
* Weak governance mechanism at all levels – minimize rate of corruption and misuse
* Hesitant to use of new and innovative technology to enhance productivity.
